# Parenthesis Matching Using Stack in C++

## Overview
This C++ program checks if expressions with parentheses are balanced using a stack.

## How Works
The program reads an expression, uses a stack to manage opening and closing parentheses, 
and outputs whether the expression is 
"Balanced" or "Not Balanced."

## Execution
**Compile and Run:**
1. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```
2. Execute the script:
   ```
   ./run.sh
   ```
